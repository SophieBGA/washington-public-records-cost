# washington-cost-of-public-records-requests

TODO:

1. Add in all the data-the more the merrier.
2. Make a summary sheet - roughly 1, but no more than two pages
3. Estimate the cost of FOIA expansion by estimating how much staff would each county need, and then estimating staff salaries
4. For jlarc 2017 the average_days_actual is Average Days Actual from sheet '5. Avg Time vs Actual Time' idk if this variable is in all the datasets... 
5. Variables to add to dfs:
6. is percent_req_closed_within_5_days the percent out of ALL requests (total_requests) or just out of closed requests?

Variables to add:

2017
reqs_closed_within_5_days
total_open_reqs
total_reqs_closed
denied in full
denied partial


2018
percent_req_completed_within_5_days,
